    <h2 class="bitBoutme">A bit about me</h2>
    <h2 class="abtMeParagraph">Hello! I am a third year student at The University of Colorado Boulder studying creative technology and design with a minor in dance. Iâ€™m passionate about design and creative problem-solving. I like exploring new ways of thinking and approaching problems from different angles.
        <br><br>
        Throughout my time at CU, I have learned about design thinking and how to combine creativity with technology. I am excited to continue growing as a designer and keep expanding my skills.
        <br><br>
        Outside of design, I'm passionate about dance and have trained in various styles, including ballet, tap, jazz and contemporary. Dance allows me to express myself creatively and stay connected to the art of movement.
