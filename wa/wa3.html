        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For each of the seven species of sea turtles, females and males are the same size. As adults, it is possible to tell male turtles from female turtles by their long tails with a cloacal opening near the tip. Adult female sea turtles have shorter tails, with a cloacal opening near the base. Hatchling and sub-adult turtles do not exhibit sexual dimorphism; it is not possible to determine their sex by looking at them.[9]
            <br><br>
            In general, sea turtles have a more fusiform body plan than their terrestrial or freshwater counterparts. This tapering at both ends reduces volume and means that sea turtles cannot retract their head and limbs into their shells for protection, unlike many other turtles and tortoises.[10] However, the streamlined body plan reduces friction and drag in the water and allows sea turtles to swim more easily and swiftly.    </div>
            
            The leatherback sea turtle is the largest sea turtle, reaching 1.4 to more than 1.8 m (4.6 to 5.9 ft) in length and weighing between 300 and 640 kg (661 to 1,411 lbs).[11] Other sea turtle species are smaller, ranging from as little as 60 cm (2 ft) long in the case of the Kemp's ridley, which is the smallest sea turtle species, to 120 cm (3.9 ft) long in the case of the green turtle, the second largest.[5][12]
            <br><br>
            The skulls of sea turtles have cheek regions that are enclosed in bone.[13][14] Although this condition appears to resemble that found in the earliest known fossil reptiles (anapsids), it is possible it is a more recently evolved trait in sea turtles, placing them outside the anapsids.[15][13]

    <h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>
    <p>Sea turtles can be found in all oceans except for the polar regions. The flatback sea turtle is found solely on the northern coast of Australia. The Kemp's ridley sea turtle is found solely in the Gulf of Mexico and along the East Coast of the United States.[30]
        <br><br>
        Sea turtles are generally found in the waters over continental shelves. During the first three to five years of life, sea turtles spend most of their time in the pelagic zone floating in seaweed mats. Green sea turtles in particular are often found in Sargassum mats, in which they find food, shelter and water.[31] Once the sea turtle has reached adulthood it moves closer to the shore.[32] Females will come ashore to lay their eggs on sandy beaches during the nesting season.[33]
        <br><br>
        Sea turtles migrate to reach their spawning beaches, which are limited in numbers. Living in the ocean therefore means they usually migrate over large distances. All sea turtles have large body sizes, which is helpful for moving large distances. Large body sizes also offer good protection against the large predators (notably sharks) found in the ocean.[34]

    <h2>Sea Turtle Species</h2>
    <p>There are seven species of sea turtles found worldwide today. Six of them are hardshell species belonging to the family Cheloniidae:
    </p>
    
    <div id="SubSection3A">
        <h3>Green turtle (Chelonia mydas)</h3>
        <img src="/img/greenTurtle.jpeg" alt="Green turtle (Chelonia mydas)" height="220" width="390" >

        <p>Perhaps the most iconic sea turtle species (e.g. Crush in Finding Nemo), the green turtle also has the most numerous and widespread nesting sites of the seven species. Green turtles are found throughout the tropical and subtropical regions of the world and in all major ocean basins. They are often found among coral reefs and in other shallow water habitats, including among seagrasses, which are a key component of their diet. Green turtles are also found basking on beaches in Hawaii (where they are known as honu), and in a few other locations like the Galápagos Islands. Green turtles were once extensively hunted for their body fat, a key ingredient in the once popular delicacy ‘turtle soup.’ Although it has become illegal to hunt sea turtles in most parts of the world, green turtles and their eggs continue to be consumed.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="SubSection3B">
        <h3>Loggerhead turtle (Caretta caretta) </h3>
        <img src="/img/loggerHead.jpg" alt="Green turtle (Chelonia mydas)" height="220" width="390" >

        <p>Loggerhead turtles are named for their large heads, with jaws powerful enough to crush an adult queen conch and other mollusks and crustaceans that make up a key component of their diet. Like some other sea turtle species, loggerheads are famed for their vast migrations. They are found worldwide, with major nesting areas in the southeast U.S., Brazil, the Mediterranean Sea, Cabo Verde, South Africa, the Middle East, Japan, and Australia. As a species that may travel thousands of miles across ocean basins, loggerheads are exposed to a wide range of threats including pollution, habitat loss, and incidental capture by fishermen.</p>

    <div id="SubSection3C">
        <h3>Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata) </h3>
        <img src="/img/hawksbill.png" alt="Hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata)" height="220" width="390" >

        <p>Named for their sharp, pointed beaks, hawksbill turtles feed primarily on reef sponges as adults. The bodies of these invertebrate organisms contain tiny indigestible glass needles, making hawksbills one of their only predators. The hawksbill has a beautiful shell that has long been exploited for use in tortoiseshell jewelry. Tortoiseshell objects have been found in the graves of the Nubian rulers of predynastic Egypt, the ruins of China’s Han Empire, and the middens of pre-Columbian cultures in the Caribbean. </p>

    <div id="SubSection3D">
        <h3>Olive ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea) </h3>
        <img src="/img/olive.jpg" alt="Olive ridley turtle (Lepidochelys olivacea)" height="220" width="390" >

        <p>Olive ridleys are the most abundant sea turtle species and yet also one of the smallest, second only to the closely related Kemp’s ridley. They are also widespread, and are found nesting on every continent and many islands across the globe. But don’t mistake the olive ridley’s wide range for ordinariness! These unique animals are also responsible for one of nature's greatest spectacles, called an arribada, Spanish for ‘arrival,’ during which thousands of olive ridleys come ashore simultaneously to nest. It is still a mystery as to how or why the turtles synchronize, though it’s hypothesized that the mass nesting overwhelms predators and allows more baby turtles to make it to the ocean. Olive ridleys are increasingly threatened by trawling and coastal development throughout their range.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="SubSection3E">
        <h3>Kemp’s ridley turtle (Lepidochelys kempii)</h3>
        <img src="/img/kemp.png" alt="Kemp’s ridley turtle (Lepidochelys kempii)" height="220" width="390" >

        <p>The Kemp’s ridley is the smallest of the sea turtles and has a restricted range, nesting only along the Caribbean shores of northern Mexico and in Texas, U.S.A. These diminutive sea turtles are a compelling example that conservation efforts can succeed, even in dire situations. Just fifty years ago, the Kemp’s ridley nearly went extinct.  Thanks to dedicated nesting beach protection, a reintroduction program, and the development and implementation of Turtle Excluder Devices in U.S. and Mexican fisheries, the species has rebounded significantly. However, the coast isn’t clear just yet,  as Kemp’s ridley populations are still just a fraction of their former size.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="SubSection3F">
        <h3>Flatback turtle (Natator depressus)</h3>
        <img src="/img/flatback.png" alt="Flatback turtle (Natator depressus)" height="220" width="390" >

        <p>The only endemic sea turtle species, flatback turtles nest solely along the northern coast of Australia and inhabit the continental shelf between Australia, southern Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. Until the late 1980s, the flatback was thought to be a subspecies of the green turtle. Now we know that flatbacks are in fact one of the most unique hardshell sea turtle species, sporting distinct features like a flattened carapace with winged edges made up of thinner, more delicate scutes. </p>
    </div>
    <div id="SubSection3G">
        <h3>Leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea)</h3>
        <img src="/img/leatherback.png" alt="Leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea)" height="220" width="390" >

        <p>The leatherback turtle’s branch on the evolutionary tree split from the other species of turtles about 100 million years ago. They have since evolved a variety of unique characteristics that set them apart, including a soft, flexible shell that is covered in a layer of leathery skin, a lack of scales, the ability to regulate their body temperatures, and their enormous size. The largest of the sea turtles, leatherbacks can reach more than 1.8 meters (6 feet) in length and weigh more than 640 kg (1,410 lbs). During their spectacularly long migrations, leatherbacks regularly dive to depths greater than 1,000 meters (3,281 feet) in search of gelatinous zooplankton (aka jellyfish) to eat. Leatherbacks are rapidly declining in some areas of the world as a result of fishing, habitat loss and degradation, egg consumption, and pollution.  </p>
