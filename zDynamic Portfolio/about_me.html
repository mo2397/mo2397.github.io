    <h2 class="bitBoutme">A bit about me</h2>
    <h2 class="abtMeParagraph">Hello! I am a third year student at The University of Colorado Boulder studying creative technology and design with a minor in dance. I'm passionate about design and exploring ways to express creativity, from graphic design to drawing, painting and even animation. I enjoy exploring different ways to bring ideas to life through different mediums whether it's digital or tactile.
        <br><br>
        During my time at CU, I have learned about design thinking and how to blend creativity with technology. I am excited to continue growing as a designer and keep expanding my skill set.
        <br><br>
        Outside of design, I’m passionate about dance and have trained in ballet, tap, jazz, and contemporary. Dance allows me to express my creativity, whether it’s in choreography or through movement.
